# [Project Name]
<br>
A Unity project focused on building a **toolkit of reusable, system-based gameplay mechanics** that draw heavy inspiration from the Immersive Sim design philosophy with an emphasis on Valve-like game feel.  
**Goal:** provide clean, composable *systems* (inventory, interaction, AI perception, damage, etc...) that can be easily extended and customized.      
<br><br>

# Core design principles
- **Composable**: systems should interoperate through interfaces/events, not hard references
- **Replaceable**: you can swap implementations (ex: different inventory UI or interaction method)
- **Inspectable**: built-in debug views/logs/gizmos
- **Data-driven**: ScriptableObjects for definitions/configs when it helps
- **Minimal coupling**: avoid “god managers”; prefer local responsibilities + messaging
